# Ici c'est Paris Tennis

Script to automatically book a tennis court (on https://tennis.paris.fr)

Credit goes to [Bertrand d'Aure](https://github.com/bertrandda) who built [par-ici-tennis](https://github.com/bertrandda/par-ici-tennis) in the first place.

## Before you start
Make sure to buy tickets on Paris tennis website to avoid errors such as the following:
```
=========================== logs ===========================
waiting for event [paymentmode="existingTicket"]
============================================================

```
##### How to?
(1) Book a court on Paris Tennis the normal way.
Select one similar to your future bookings:
- Full price or with a discount
- Indoor or Outdoor

(2) On the payment page buy multiples tickets (3 to 10 hours)

(3) Confirm booking and buy tickets

(4) Cancel the booking and you'll get the credit back

You're good to go ðŸŽ¾

## Get started
Create `config.json` file from `config.json.sample` and complete with your preferences.

`location` a string representing the name of the court â€” [full list](https://airtable.com/shrNCuXYBTcjQBg7X)

`date` a string representing a date formated DD/MM/YYYY â€” eg: "24/11/2022"

`hour` a string representing the starting hour formated HH â€” eg: "08"

`court_id` a string representing the court ID â€” [find Court ID here](https://airtable.com/shrH4BCvssntJn9oB/tblMzdkwf9fNEztGy)

`player` two strings representing the other player full name

To run this project locally, install the dependencies and run the script:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

To run with a delay - typically when you want to be the first to book for next week at 08:00 AM

```sh
while [ $(date +%H:%M:%S) != "08:00:05" ]; do sleep 1; echo $(date +%H:%M:%S) "wait for it... wait for it"; done; npm start
```
